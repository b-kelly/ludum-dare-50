These colonists only landed about seven years ago, as far as you know, but their base might as well be an ancient ruin. The stiff plastic polymer that comprises the dome’s membrane is all but disintegrated, and the structure itself is pock-marked and brittle. The materials seem to be of lower quality than the ones that make up your base. There's no sign of any crew members.",
